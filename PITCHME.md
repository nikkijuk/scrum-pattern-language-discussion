## Definitions
---
[A pattern]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern) is a regularity in the world, in human-made design, or in abstract ideas. As such, the elements of a pattern repeat in a predictable manner.
---
[Software design pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern) is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design.
---
[A pattern language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_language) is an organized and coherent set of patterns, each of which describes a problem and the core of a solution that can be used in many ways within a specific field of expertise.
