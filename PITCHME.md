## agenda
- scrum, patterns & scrum patterns
- development idea: project pattern language
- extra slides: how organizational patterns have influenced early scrum  
---
## Whatever you do, just call it Scrum. 

### Scrum is: 
-	Lightweight => Vague, used inconsistently
-	Simple to understand => 17 pages? 3-5-3?
-	Difficult to master => but simple to get certified

## One principle

### Gojko Adzic 2009
"I am getting more and more convinced every day that communication is, in fact, what makes or breaks software projects. Programming tools, practices and methods are definitely important, but if the communication fails then the rest is just painting the corpse."
---
## Team phases
---
### [Scott Downey](https://www.scruminc.com/scrum-shock-therapy-how-to-change-teams/) 2012
"The Framework of Scrum provides many options for customization and interpretation for each Team. In my experience, most teams just starting out are so overwhelmed with choices and potential that they can't find a constructive way to start."

## What are patterns?
---
[A pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern) is a regularity in the world, in human-made design, or in abstract ideas. As such, the elements of a pattern repeat in a predictable manner.
---
- [Software design pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern) is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design.
- [Organisational patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organizational_patterns) are arrangements or systems of internal relationship which give to any culture its coherence.
- [A Scrum Pattern](http://scrumbook.org/) is a general reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within the Scrum framework.
---
[A pattern language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_language) is an organized and coherent set of patterns, each of which describes a problem and the core of a solution that can be used in many ways within a specific field of expertise. 
---
## Examples of pattern languages
---
### Coplien & Harrison 2004.
- [Organizational Patterns of Agile Software Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organizational_patterns)
- "human and organizational dimension of the software improvement process and software project management". 
- Pattern languages for Organisational Style, People & Code, Piecemeal Growth & Project management.
- Examples: Self selecting team, Unity of Purpose, ..

### Sutherland et al 2019
- ["A Scrum Book"](https://pragprog.com/titles/jcscrum/)
- "Scrum Guide describes the basic rules of Scrum, the patterns amplify the guide by showing teams how to solve problems in a specific context."
- Product Organization (1-39) and Value Stream (40-94) [Pattern Languages](https://sites.google.com/a/scrumplop.org/published-patterns/book-outline/patlets) extend [core patterns](https://sites.google.com/a/scrumplop.org/published-patterns/book-outline/the-core-patterns-in-brief).
- [A Project Language of Highly Effective Teams](https://sites.google.com/a/scrumplop.org/published-patterns/sequences/a-project-language-of-highly-effective-teams) as example of project pattern language.

### Other Organisational pattern languages
- [Agile & Lean Software architecture practice patterns](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/dp/B07X8289XR/) by Stefan Toth.
- [Organizational change Patterns](https://fearlesschangepatterns.com/) by Linda Rising & Mary Manns.
- [Liberating structures engagement patterns](http://www.liberatingstructures.com/) by Keith McCandless and Henri Lipmanowicz.
---
## organisational improvement 
---
### apply organisational patterns
- Find the weakest part of your organization
- Find a pattern that is likely to strengthen it
- Apply the pattern
- Measure the improvement or degradation
- If the pattern improved things, go to step 1 and find the next improvement; otherwise, undo the pattern and try an alternative.
---
## Idea: "Agile@Jambit" Pattern Language(s) 
---
### Accept known state
- Scrum is not a problem: how our industry uses it is.
- There's no stable body of knowledge, so we can and need to selects and document our own practices.
---
### Create initial prototype process  
- envision default process which adresses current needs.
- make fork of selected industry practices and share them as pattern language.
---
### Design for defaults
- each team should be aware of default process, which they can tailor for own needs.
- make sure it's easy to do right thing: [selecting default](https://jamesclear.com/design-default) should be easy and not selecting default should be possible.
---
### Invite to co-develop 
- record lessons learned, evaluate where we are as company and as industry, and see if pattern language needs adjusting
- steering of pattern language maintenance could be done at existing CoP, see [Bird of Feather §5](https://sites.google.com/a/scrumplop.org/published-patterns/product-organization-pattern-language/birds-of-a-feather)  
---
## How to start? First make plan.. together
---
### Coplien 14.6.2020
- "Let me suggest that we run a two-day [Scrum patterns seminar](https://agilix.nl/scrum-patterns/) together."
- "it is an excellent event, and very suitable both for team building and for creating a concrete improvement plan."
- "I'd much prefer to do it on-site if your situation and the timing allow." 
---
## Project pattern language

### Sutherland & al 2014
- ["Teams that Finish Early Accelerate Faster: A Pattern Language for High Performing Scrum Teams"](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Teams-That-Finish-Early-Accelerate-Faster%3A-A-for-Sutherland-Harrison/cb929a4e0a9fd949fbc16bb29da0d8995d23a6bb)

## hyperproductivity patterns
---
### [Stable Teams §15](https://sites.google.com/a/scrumplop.org/published-patterns/product-organization-pattern-language/development-team/stable-teams)  
- If you need predictability, then keep teams stable and avoid shuffling people around between teams.
---
### [Yesterday’s Weather §66](https://sites.google.com/a/scrumplop.org/published-patterns/value-stream/estimation-points/yesterday-s-weather)
- If courage emboldens the team to set overoptimistic goals, then refer to the work Done in the last Sprint to forecast the work for the upcoming Sprint.
---
### [Swarming: One Piece Continuous Flow §25](https://sites.google.com/a/scrumplop.org/published-patterns/product-organization-pattern-language/development-team/swarming--one-piece-continuous-flow)
- Working on too many things at once reduces velocity and the quality of work. Therefore, have the whole Development Team work together on one Product Backlog Item at a time.
---
### [Interrupt Pattern: Illigitimus Non Interruptus §33](https://sites.google.com/a/scrumplop.org/published-patterns/product-organization-pattern-language/illegitimus-non-interruptus)
- If various stakeholders and emergent requirements interrupt the team, crippling its progress, then explicitly allot time for interrupts and time-box unplanned work to that budget.
---
### [Good Housekeeping aka Daily Clean Code §80](https://sites.google.com/a/scrumplop.org/published-patterns/value-stream/good-housekeeping)
- Where there’s a mess, you lose time and energy finding where and what to start on. Therefore, maintain a completely clean product and work environment continuously, or clean at the end of each day.
---
### [Emergency Procedure §32](https://sites.google.com/a/scrumplop.org/published-patterns/product-organization-pattern-language/emergency-procedure)
- Inevitably, unanticipated problems arise and cause the Sprint Goal to slip out of reach, but waiting until the Sprint Review derails the whole Sprint. Therefore, reevaluate the work plan mid-Sprint and escalate the solution with a predefined procedure.
---
### [Scrumming the Scrum §92](https://sites.google.com/a/scrumplop.org/published-patterns/retrospective-pattern-language/scrumming-the-scrum)
- Scrum is more than just doing work; it’s also about improving the way we work. Therefore, resolve the most important impediment by putting one in the Product Backlog every Sprint.
---
### [Happiness Metric §91](https://sites.google.com/a/scrumplop.org/published-patterns/retrospective-pattern-language/happiness-metric)
- If a growing list of improvement activities dampens the team's passion for the work, then prioritize the items on the impediment list in order of the team’s passion to solve them.
---
### [Teams that Finish Early Accelerate Faster §74](https://sites.google.com/a/scrumplop.org/published-patterns/retrospective-pattern-language/teams-that-finish-early-accelerate-faster)
- Teams often take too much work into a Sprint and cannot finish it. Failure to attain the Sprint Goal prevents the team from improving. Therefore, take less work into a Sprint.
---
# team patterns

### [Collocated Team §8](https://sites.google.com/a/scrumplop.org/published-patterns/product-organization-pattern-language/development-team/collocated-team) 
- If the complexity of collaborative development demands high-fidelity communication, then locate the team together within talking distance.
---
### [Small Teams §9](https://sites.google.com/a/scrumplop.org/published-patterns/product-organization-pattern-language/development-team/small-teams)
- Having many people working on the same thing inflates communication overhead. Therefore, use small teams of people working on serialized work rather than striving for false parallelism.
---
### [Cross-Functional Team §10](https://sites.google.com/a/scrumplop.org/published-patterns/product-organization-pattern-language/development-team/cross-functional-team) 
- Organizations often organize around areas of competence, but it is too slow to coordinate across these boundaries. Therefore, the team as a whole should embody all the talent necessary to deliver product.
---
### [Autonomous Team §16](https://sites.google.com/a/scrumplop.org/published-patterns/product-organization-pattern-language/development-team/autonomous-team)
- If policies and procedures applied across multiple contexts are dysfunctional, then the Scrum Team governs its work free from external control, and the Development Team manages its own work.
---
### [Self-Organising Team §17](https://sites.google.com/a/scrumplop.org/published-patterns/product-organization-pattern-language/development-team/self-organizing-team)
- Specialized skills can't accomplish work without coordination. Therefore, the Development Team organizes itself to get its work Done.

---
### Cunningham 1995
- ["EPISODES: A Pattern Language of Competitive Development"](episodes.fed.wiki.org/) 
- "We find ourselves unable under competitive pressure to make the kind of careful decisions we would like. These patterns tell what decisions can be made, in fact should be made, to maintain continuous forward motion through iterative development."

- "Each situation results from some force getting out of balance. So, one pattern may remedy several situations."
- "Similarly, any one situation has several possible remedies, depending on small variations in the situation, or your personal management style."
